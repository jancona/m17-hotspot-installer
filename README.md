# M17 CC1200/SX1255/MMDVM Hotspot Installation Script

This repository contains a Bash script to convert a Raspberry Pi (with a CC1200, SX1255 or MMDVM hat) into a fully functional **M17 digital voice hotspot**. The script automates the entire installation and setup process, including compiling the necessary software, configuring UART, setting up the web dashboard, and flashing the firmware to the HAT (optional).

---

## Install Script Usage

Execute the following on the Raspberry Pi to download the installer:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M17-Project/m17-hotspot-installer/refs/heads/main/m17-hotspot-installer.sh
```

Carefully read the script before you execute it with:

```
chmod u+x m17-hotspot-installer.sh
sudo ./m17-hotspot-installer.sh
```

Options: `-n` skips flashing the modem firmware; `-q` installs the QTC messaging node without asking.

### QTC messaging (experimental)

Near the end, the installer offers to install [QTC](https://github.com/jancona/qtc), a store-and-forward text messaging node for M17, currently in an invite-only test. It installs the `qtcd` package, configures it with your callsign and your gateway's current reflector, and adds `M17-QTC 127.0.0.1 17000` to `OverrideHosts.txt`. Your gateway is not changed: to use QTC, choose reflector `M17-QTC`, module `A` in 'Gateway Config'. Voice still reaches your previous reflector; SMS goes into QTC. Messages are not private and callsigns are not verified.

## Features

- Verifies root and OS requirements
- Ensures it's run on a **fresh install** of Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Bookworm, 64-bit)
- Configures UART for GPIO access
- Prompts for required reboots after system update and boot option changes
- Installs all necessary packages via APT
- Creates a dedicated _m17_ user for running services
- Clones and compiles the following M17 Project repositories:
  - [CC1200_HAT-fw](https://github.com/M17-Project/CC1200_HAT-fw) (firmware flashing optional)
  - [MMDVM](https://github.com/M17-Project/MMDVM) (firmware flashing optional)
  - [MMDVM_HS](https://github.com/M17-Project/MMDVM_HS) (firmware flashing optional)
  - [rpi-dashboard](https://github.com/M17-Project/rpi-dashboard) (web interface)
- Installs [m17-gateway](https://github.com/jancona/m17)
- Configures NGINX and PHP-FPM to serve the dashboard
- Optionally flashes/updates the CC1200 or MMDVM HAT firmware via stm32flash
- Script may be re-run to update software to the latest version

## Tested Hardware and OS

This script was tested on:

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**
- **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), Bookworm (Debian 12-based)**

Other Pi models or OS versions may work but are **not officially supported**.

---

## Prerequisites

- Fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm **Lite (64-bit)**
- Raspberry Pi with internet access
- CC1200, SX1255 or MMDVM HAT connected
- Run the script as **root**

---

## File Summary

- `/opt/m17/` - Main working directory for M17-related repositories
- `/opt/m17/rpi-dashboard/` - Web interface root (served by NGINX)
- `/opt/m17/m17-gateway/` - m17-gateway installation root
- `/etc/rpi-gateway.ini` - Gateway configuration file
- `/boot/firmware/config.txt` - UART settings applied here

---

## Hotspot Usage

This script builds an M17 hotspot which consists of two software components:

- [m17-gateway](https://github.com/jancona/m17)
- [rpi-dashboard](https://github.com/M17-Project/rpi-dashboard)

Please read the manual of both software packages.

To start _m17-gateway_ manually, just execute the following line:

```
sudo systemctl start m17-gateway.service
```

This service will connect you to the M17 reflector of your choice and writes all available info to the console.

To access the dashboard, simply navigate your browser to _http://<IP_OF_YOUR_RPI>_.

The default configuration after installation works for CC1200 HATs. You will have to make config changes for SX1255 or MMDVM hardware.

### SX1255 Configuration

The following fields in Gateway Config may have to be changed for the SX1255:

* Under *Radio*:
  * For duplex operation, *Duplex* must be set to `true`.
  * To run in Duplex mode, the *RXFrequency* and *TXFrequency* must be different.
* Under *Modem*:
  * *Type* must be set to `sx1255`.

### MMDVM Configuration

The following fields in Gateway Config may have to be changed for MMDVM:

* Under *Radio*:
  * To run a Duplex HAT in duplex mode, *Duplex* must be set to `true`.
  * To run in Duplex mode, the *RXFrequency* and *TXFrequency* must be different.
* Under *Modem*:
  * *Type* must be set to `mmdvm`.
  * *Baud Rate* may need to be changed to the value the HAT supports, often `115200` for hotspots.

## Disclaimer

This script makes **system-wide changes** and should **only be run on a clean install**. Do **not** use on a production system or one with existing services unless you know what you're doing.
